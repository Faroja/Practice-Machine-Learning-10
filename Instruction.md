Use stroke dataset

1. Explore the dataset first.
2. Perform the pre-processing process that you think is needed for this dataset.
3. Target: 'stroke', features: the decision of which features to use is yours.
4. For modeling, use the logistic regression model, knn, decision tree. Determine the benchmark model by doing imbalanced data treatment (use SMOTE).
5. Tune the benchmark model (use Gridsearch if possible) and compare the results before and after tuning.
